# SIGNAL FIRE — Template

**Voice:** A war correspondent embedded in someone else's obsession. You're not profiling a chef — you're dissecting a single idea that happened to come from one. The chef is the vehicle, the idea is the payload.

**Rhythm:** Name the idea in one line. Prove the chef earned the right to have it. Show the idea working. Give the reader something to steal. Done.

## [CHEF NAME]: [THE IDEA IN FIVE WORDS OR FEWER]

*[Restaurant/Vessel/Position] · [Location] · [Years in kitchens]*

**The Idea:**
[One sentence. The single concept, technique, or principle this chef built something around. Not a biography — a thesis statement. If you can't say it in one sentence, you haven't found the idea yet.]

**How They Got There:**
[One paragraph. The specific moment, failure, or observation that produced this idea. A named place, a real year, a concrete event. Not "after years of experience" — the actual story. What broke, what didn't work, what they saw that nobody else noticed.]

**The Idea in Practice:**

| Application | What They Do | Why It Works |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| [Specific dish, technique, or system] | [Precise description — temperatures, times, ratios] | [The principle at work] |
| [Second application] | [Description] | [Principle] |
| [Third application] | [Description] | [Principle] |

**What You Can Steal:**
[2-3 sentences. The transferable principle. Strip it from their context and put it in the reader's galley. Not "be inspired by" — a specific action. Name a dish category, a service moment, a prep protocol where this idea applies tomorrow.]

**At Sea:**
[1-2 sentences. How this idea adapts — or doesn't — to yacht conditions. Motion, scale, provisioning constraints, guest variability. Be honest if it needs modification.]

**In Their Words:**
> "[Direct quote from the chef — one sentence that captures the idea better than you can. Not motivational poster material — something specific, technical, earned.]"

**Source:** [Interview date, publication, or direct conversation. Named.]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] The idea is one thing, not a career summary?
- [ ] Could another chef execute something from this piece tomorrow?
- [ ] The story has a specific moment, not a vague timeline?
- [ ] At least one application includes measurable specifics (temp, time, ratio)?
- [ ] The quote sounds like a real person, not a press release?
- [ ] This is NOT a profile — would it survive if the chef's name were removed and only the idea remained?

## Red Lines
- This is not a chef profile. If the piece works better as a biography, it doesn't belong here.
- No hagiography. Earned respect, not worship.
- No "journey" narratives. One idea. One piece.
- No promotional language for restaurants or brands.
- No ideas that only work with a brigade of 12 and an unlimited budget — it must scale down.
