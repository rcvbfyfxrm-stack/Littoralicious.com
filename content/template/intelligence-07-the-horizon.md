# THE HORIZON — Template

**Voice:** A trusted colleague who just got back from somewhere and has one thing worth telling you. No cheerleading, no PR copy — genuine recognition of work that matters. If it wouldn't make a tired chef look up from their prep list, it doesn't run.

**Rhythm:** What happened → Who did it → Why it matters to someone holding a knife right now. Celebration without inflation.

## [HEADLINE: What happened, stated plainly — no superlatives]

*[Date] · [Location]*

**What Happened:**
[One paragraph. The event, achievement, or development. Named people, named places, named dates. What actually occurred — not what a publicist wants you to think occurred. If it's an award, name the criteria. If it's an event, name the scale.]

**Who:**
[1-2 sentences. The chef(s) or organization involved. Relevant background only — years in kitchens, what they're known for technically, where they trained. Not a biography. If they're already well-known, one sentence. If they're not, earn the reader's attention with specifics.]

**Why This Matters:**
[2-3 sentences. The significance beyond the headline. What does this signal for the profession? A technique gaining recognition, a region emerging, a standard being raised, a barrier being broken. Connect it to something the reader cares about professionally.]

**The Detail Worth Knowing:**
[One paragraph. The single specific detail that separates this from every other news summary. A number, a technique mentioned, a quote, a policy change, a menu detail. Something concrete that rewards the reader for reading past the headline.]

**Source:** [Named publication, official announcement, or wire service with date]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Would a chef in any country find this worth knowing?
- [ ] The achievement or event is verified, not rumored?
- [ ] The piece celebrates without inflating — no "groundbreaking," "revolutionary," "iconic"?
- [ ] At least one specific detail goes beyond what a headline could convey?
- [ ] Positive without being promotional — no restaurant plugs disguised as news?
- [ ] Relevant to the craft, not just celebrity?

## Selection Criteria
- **Run it:** Record-setting achievements backed by data. Events that advance the profession. Recognition of technical excellence. Policy changes that affect working chefs. Emerging regions or traditions gaining deserved attention.
- **Kill it:** Award announcements with no technical substance. Celebrity chef gossip. Restaurant openings (unless the concept genuinely advances something). Anything that reads like a press release. "Youngest chef to..." unless the work itself is remarkable.

## Banned Framing
- No "culinary world stunned by..." — the culinary world is working, not being stunned
- No "puts [city] on the map" — the city was already there
- No "redefines [cuisine]" — it doesn't, and that's fine
- No listicle roundups — one story, told properly
