## Brand Research Checklist

Before recommending a brand, verify:
- [ ] Production method (traditional vs. industrial)
- [ ] Origin authenticity (actually from where it claims?)
- [ ] Ingredient list (hidden additives?)
- [ ] Professional reputation (used in respected restaurants?)
- [ ] Availability (reliably sourceable?)
- [ ] Shelf stability (appropriate for yacht storage?)
- [ ] Price-to-quality ratio at each tier
