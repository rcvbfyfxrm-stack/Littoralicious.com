# THE METHOD — Template

**Voice:** A coach, not a teacher. Short sentences. Imperative mood. You're in the galley standing next to them. No theory without immediate practice.

**Rhythm:** Provoke, instruct, explain, prove. Every section earns the next. If they stop reading after "The Move," they're already better. Say in one sentence what others say in a book.

**Word Count:** No limit — but every sentence must earn its place. If a word doesn't teach, cut it. Concise does not mean short. It means nothing wasted.

## [TECHNIQUE NAME]: [Subtitle that kills a sacred cow]

**The Move:** [One sentence. What you're going to do differently starting now.]

**Do This:**
1. [Action — precise, no ambiguity. Include temperature, time, visual cue.]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]
4. [Action — maximum 5 steps. If it needs more, it's not a technique brief, it's a recipe.]

**Why It Works:**
[2-3 sentences. Name the reaction, the compound, the physics. Numbers. Not "high heat makes things brown."]

**The Variables:**

| Factor | What Happens | Adjust By |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |

**You Know It Worked When:**
[Measurable outcome. Temperature reading, visual cue, texture test, taste marker. Not "it looks good." Specific.]

**At Sea:**
[One sentence. Motion, humidity, equipment, timing — the yacht-specific consideration that separates this from a food blog.]

**Source:** [Named researcher, book, or paper.]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Can be executed during service, not just during prep?
- [ ] At least one specific number (temp, time, ratio, percentage)?
- [ ] Names the scientific principle by name?
- [ ] Kills a common myth or corrects a widespread mistake?
- [ ] Interesting enough that a chef reads it twice, not because they have to — because they want to?
