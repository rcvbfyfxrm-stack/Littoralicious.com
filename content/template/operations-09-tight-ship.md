# TIGHT SHIP — Template

**Voice:** A systems engineer who cooks. No fluff. Problem → solution → proof. If it can't be quantified, it doesn't belong here.

**Rhythm:** Name the pain. Fix the pain. Prove you fixed it. Warn what can break.

## [PROTOCOL NAME]
*[Category: Prep / Service / Storage / Cleanup / Provisioning / Equipment / Workflow]*

**The Pain:**
[One sentence. A specific frustration they feel daily or weekly. Not abstract — visceral.]

**The Protocol:**
1. [Action — verb first, specific, measurable]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]
4. [Action]
5. [Action — maximum 5 steps. If it needs more, split into two protocols.]

**Why It Works:**
[One paragraph. The principle — workflow science, thermodynamics, ergonomics, cognitive load reduction. Not just "it's faster." Why is it faster?]

**The Proof:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Time | [X minutes] | [Y minutes] |
| Steps/movements | [Count] | [Count] |
| Error rate | [Frequency] | [Frequency] |

**The Catch:**
[What can go wrong. When NOT to use this. An honest limitation. This builds trust.]
