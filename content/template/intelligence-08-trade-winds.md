**Rhythm:** What changed → What it means for your next season → What to do about it. If there's no actionable takeaway, it's not industry news — it's gossip.

## [HEADLINE: Specific development stated plainly — no hype]

*[Date] · [Region/Scope: Mediterranean / Caribbean / Global / Flag State]*

**The Development:**
[One paragraph. What changed, who announced it, when it takes effect. Regulation, certification, hiring trend, agency news, event, training program, insurance change, flag state policy, charter market shift. Named organizations, specific dates, exact figures where available.]

**Who's Affected:**
[1-2 sentences. Which chefs this impacts and how. Be specific: all yacht chefs? Only chefs on vessels over 500GT? Only those working charter? Only those with specific certifications? Define the scope.]

**What It Means:**
[2-3 sentences. Practical translation. How does this change what a yacht chef does, earns, plans, or prepares for? If it's a regulation — what's the compliance timeline? If it's a market shift — what does demand look like? If it's an event — what's the actual value of attending?]

**Key Details:**

| Detail | Specifics |
|--------|-----------|
| [Effective date / Event date] | [Date] |
| [Cost / Salary range / Fee] | [Figures in EUR and $ where applicable] |
| [Requirements / Eligibility] | [Who qualifies, what's needed] |
| [Deadline / Registration] | [Date and how] |

**Your Move:**
[One sentence. One action. Update a certification, register for something, adjust a budget, talk to your captain, review a contract clause. Or: "Monitor only — no action needed yet."]

**Source:** [Named organization, publication, or official announcement with date and link if available]

- [ ] Includes at least one specific number (date, salary figure, vessel size threshold, cost)?
- [ ] Actionable — the reader knows what to do or explicitly knows no action is needed?
- [ ] Distinguishes between confirmed and upcoming/proposed changes?

## Coverage Areas

## Red Lines

- No broker/charter marketing dressed as market analysis
- No unverified salary claims — cite the source or don't publish
- No "the future of yacht cheffing" speculation — report what's happening, not what might
- No coverage of yacht shows unless there's a specific chef-relevant development
- No sponsored content or preferred agency promotion
