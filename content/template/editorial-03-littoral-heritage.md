# LITTORAL HERITAGE — Template

**Voice:** A grandmother who happens to have a chemistry degree. She doesn't give you the recipe first — she sits you down and tells you why this dish exists. Warm but precise. Opinionated. The reader should feel the salt air and hear the harbour before they see a single ingredient.

**Rhythm:** Place them there → Tell them why this dish had to exist → Show them the tradition → Prove it with science → Bring it aboard. This is not a how-to. This is a preservation act.

**Word Count:** No limit — but concise. Every paragraph must earn its place. If it doesn't make the reader feel like they were there when this dish was born, cut it.

## [DISH NAME]
*[Original language name] · [Literal translation if revealing]*

**[Village/Port/Coastline], [Region]** — [One sentence that places this dish on a specific stretch of coast. Not a country — a harbour, a fishing village, a stretch of shore. Name it.]

### The Origin

[The true story. Not mythology, not "legend has it" — verified history. A named person if possible, a specific decade at minimum, a real circumstance. Why did this dish come into being? What problem did it solve? Was it poverty, abundance, preservation, celebration, survival? Place the reader in that moment. They should smell the kitchen, hear the language, feel the necessity.

Cross-check every claim. If the origin is disputed, say so — and present what's documented.]

### Why It Mattered

[1-2 paragraphs. The role this dish played in its community. Was it daily sustenance or feast-day ritual? Did it feed fishermen before dawn or celebrate a catch? What does it say about the people who made it — their coastline, their economy, their relationship with the sea? What would be lost if this dish disappeared?

This section earns the recipe. If the reader doesn't understand why this dish needed to exist, the rest is just instructions.]

### The Tradition

[How it was made — and still is, where authenticity survives. Not a step-by-step recipe. The method as narrative. The grandmother's hands, the specific clay pot, the wood fire, the tide-dependent timing. What makes the traditional preparation different from what a restaurant does today? What shortcuts have diluted it? What's non-negotiable?

Only include method detail that matters for an advanced chef — the technique that defines the dish, the step most people get wrong, the timing that separates good from true. Skip the obvious.]

**The Non-Negotiables:**

| Element | Traditional | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [Key ingredient or technique] | [How it was/is done authentically] | [What changes if you compromise] |
| [Element] | [Traditional approach] | [Consequence of deviation] |
| [Element] | [Traditional approach] | [Consequence] |

### Why It Works (The Science)

[The chemistry and physics behind the tradition. Why did the grandmother's method produce something that modern shortcuts can't replicate? Name the reactions — Maillard, enzymatic browning, protein denaturation, emulsification, fermentation, osmosis. Cite the science. The tradition got there by instinct; explain it with evidence.

This is not a textbook. One or two key scientific truths that make the reader respect the tradition more, not less.]

### On Board — The Yacht Showstopper

[How to bring this dish aboard with integrity. Not a dumbed-down version — a respectful adaptation that honours the origin while working within yacht service.

Think: crossing the coastline where this dish was born and serving it that evening. Or bringing a guest back to a memory of that region. What makes this a story on the plate, not just food?

Be specific about what to adapt and what to protect. Plating that respects the dish's nature. Service timing. The one thing to say when a guest asks "what is this?" — the sentence that makes them put down their phone.]

### Pairing

[One wine, spirit, or drink from the same coast or tradition. Specific — a grape, a region, a style. One sentence on why it belongs with this dish. If the traditional pairing is water, say so.]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Origin story is factually verified — no "legend has it" without documented source?
- [ ] A named person, specific place, or documented historical moment anchors the story?
- [ ] The reader understands why this dish had to exist before seeing any method?
- [ ] Science section names specific reactions and is verifiable?
- [ ] Traditional method detail is limited to what an advanced chef needs — no basics?
- [ ] Yacht adaptation respects the dish — it's a showstopper, not a shortcut?
- [ ] Every claim is cross-checked? If disputed, the dispute is acknowledged?

## Selection Criteria
- Coastal or littoral origin — born from the sea, the shore, or the port
- Documented tradition — not invented, not "inspired by"
- A story that earns telling — necessity, survival, celebration, identity
- The science is interesting — something happens in this dish that rewards understanding
- Can be served aboard as a genuine moment, not just a menu item

## Red Lines
- This is NOT a recipe article. No step-by-step how-to format.
- No dishes without verifiable coastal/littoral roots
- No romanticised origins — if you can't source it, don't claim it
- No "fusion" or "modern interpretation" as the subject — the tradition is the subject
- No dishes chosen for Instagram appeal over cultural substance
