# THE BLUEPRINT — Template

**Voice:** Active verbs, specific numbers, visual cues. "Whisk" not "The ingredients should be whisked." Every recipe from scientifically tested sources (ChefSteps, Food Lab, Modernist Cuisine, Serious Eats, ATK, Harold McGee).

**Rhythm:** Hook → At a Glance → Ingredients by mise group → Phased method with checkpoints → Science → Elevation tiers → Prep-ahead → Troubleshooting → Quick reference card.

**Word Count:** Variable by complexity · **Read Time:** 8-15 min
