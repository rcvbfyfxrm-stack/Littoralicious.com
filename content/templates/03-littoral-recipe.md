# LITTORAL RECIPE — Template

**Voice:** A grandmother who happens to have a chemistry degree. Warm but precise. Opinionated. This is not a recipe — it's a short story with ingredients.

**Rhythm:** Make them care about the dish before they read a single ingredient. The story earns the recipe. The science earns the technique. The yacht adaptation earns their trust.

## [RECIPE NAME]
*[Original language name if different]*

**[Region], [Coast]** — [One sentence that places this dish in the world. Not a country — a coastline, a port, a village.]

**The Story:**
[One paragraph. Who makes this, when, and why it exists. A person, not a population. A moment, not a century. The reader should care about the dish before they see a single ingredient. If the story doesn't make them want to cook it, rewrite the story.]

**Yield:** [Specific — "Serves 6 as a starter, 4 as a main"]
**Active time:** [Hands-on work only]
**Total time:** [Including resting, cooling, marinating]
**Difficulty:** [1-5: 1 = mise only, 2 = basic technique, 3 = timing matters, 4 = requires practice, 5 = you'll fail the first time]

| [Item] | [Amount] | [Note] |

**[Component 2 name]:**

### Method

**[Component 1]:**
1. [Instruction — temperature, time, and a visual/sensory cue. Every step answers "how do I know it's done?"]
2. [Instruction]
3. [Instruction]

**[Component 2]:**
1. [Instruction]
2. [Instruction]

**To Finish:**
1. [Assembly]
2. [The last gesture — the one that elevates it]

### Why This Works (The Science)
[One technique in the recipe, explained. Not all of them — one. The one that makes the biggest difference. 2-3 sentences.]

### Yacht Adaptation
- **Prep ahead:** [What can be done 24h, 4h, 1h in advance. Be specific.]
- **Hold:** [How long it holds, how, and what degrades. Be honest — "terrible holder" is a valid answer.]
- **Motion:** [What to watch for in sea state 3+]
- **Scale:** [Up/down notes. Linear or not? Wider pot vs. deeper?]

### Plating
[2 sentences. Classic presentation. If this dish shouldn't be plated — say so.]

### Pairing
[One wine or drink. Specific producer or style. One sentence.]

## Example: Caldeirada

### Caldeirada
*Portuguese Fish Stew*

**Olhão, Algarve** — where a fisherman's widow made this with whatever the boats couldn't sell at morning market.

**The Story:**
Caldeirada exists because Portuguese fishermen needed to eat the unsellable catch — the fish too ugly for market, the pieces too small to fillet. It's poverty cooking that became tradition. The rule: at least three types of fish, always include something gelatinous (ray, monkfish cheek) for body, and never stir once assembled or you'll break the fish. You shake the pot instead. Maria Josefina Santos, who ran the kitchen at Restaurante Bela Vista in Olhão until she was 83, insisted you must assemble it cursing the sea for being so cruel. The cursing is optional. The not-stirring is not.

**Yield:** Serves 6 generously
**Active time:** 25 min
**Total time:** 45 min
**Difficulty:** 2/5 (technique is in the layering, not the cooking)

### Ingredients

**The Base:**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Olive oil | 80ml | Portuguese if possible |
| Onions | 3 large | Sliced into half-moons |
| Garlic | 6 cloves | Sliced, not minced |
| Bay leaves | 3 | Fresh if available |
| Ripe tomatoes | 500g | Peeled, roughly chopped |
| Dry white wine | 200ml | Vinho Verde ideal |
| Fish stock | 400ml | Or clam juice + water |

**The Fish (choose 3-4):**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Firm white fish | 400g | Monkfish, sea bass, or bream — 5cm pieces |
| Flaky fish | 300g | Cod, hake — larger pieces, they break easily |
| Gelatinous | 200g | Ray wing, monkfish cheek, or skate — non-negotiable |
| Shellfish | 300g | Clams, mussels, or prawns (optional) |
| Potatoes | 500g | Waxy, sliced 5mm thick |

**To Finish:**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Fresh coriander | Large handful | Roughly chopped |
| Piri piri | To taste | Optional |
| Olive oil | Generous | Your best, for finishing |

### Method

**Build the Base:**
1. In a wide, heavy pot (cataplana if you have one), heat olive oil over medium heat
2. Add half the onions, half the garlic, bay leaves. Cook until softened and translucent, ~8 minutes. No color.
3. Add tomatoes, wine, stock. Simmer 10 minutes until slightly reduced — you should smell the wine burn off

**Layer the Stew:**
1. Remove pot from heat
2. Layer in this order: potatoes, remaining raw onions and garlic, firm fish, flaky fish, gelatinous fish, shellfish on top
3. Season each layer with salt as you build
4. Do not stir. The layers matter.

**Cook:**
1. Return to medium heat. Cover tightly.
2. Cook 18-22 minutes. Shake the pot gently every 5 minutes — never stir.
3. Fish is done when it flakes easily and shellfish have opened. Discard any that don't.
4. Remove from heat. Rest covered 5 minutes.

**To Finish:**
1. Scatter coriander over the surface
2. Drizzle generously with your best olive oil. Bring the pot to the table.

### Why This Works (The Science)
The layering isn't tradition for tradition's sake. Potatoes on the bottom absorb direct heat, protecting delicate fish above. Gelatinous fish releases collagen into the broth — you're making stock and stew simultaneously. Firm fish sits lower where heat is stronger; flaky fish higher where it's gentler. The no-stirring rule preserves the pieces — you're braising, not making soup. Shaking redistributes liquid without mechanical force that would break the fish.

### Yacht Adaptation
- **Prep ahead:** Base can be made 24h ahead, refrigerated. Layer fish just before cooking.
- **Hold:** Terrible holder. Fish continues cooking in residual heat. Make it as close to service as possible.
- **Motion:** The wide pot is ideal — low center of gravity. Use the gimbal above sea state 3.
- **Scale:** Scales linearly. Use a wider pot, not deeper — depth = uneven cooking between layers.

### Plating
Don't. Serve family-style from the pot with crusty bread and good salt. On yacht, use a beautiful copper or ceramic vessel that can go to table. Individual plating kills the spirit of this dish entirely.

### Pairing
Vinho Verde — Soalheiro Alvarinho if you can source it. Young, unoaked white from the Alentejo works too. Serve cold.
