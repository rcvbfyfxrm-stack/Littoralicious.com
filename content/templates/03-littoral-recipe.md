# LITTORAL RECIPE — Template

**Voice:** A grandmother who happens to have a chemistry degree. Warm but precise. Opinionated. This is not a recipe — it's a short story with ingredients.

**Rhythm:** Make them care about the dish before they read a single ingredient. The story earns the recipe. The science earns the technique. The yacht adaptation earns their trust.

**Word Count:** 500-700 · **Read Time:** 2-3 min

## [RECIPE NAME]
*[Original language name if different]*

**[Region], [Coast]** — [One sentence that places this dish in the world. Not a country — a coastline, a port, a village.]

**The Story:**
[One paragraph. Who makes this, when, and why it exists. A person, not a population. A moment, not a century. The reader should care about the dish before they see a single ingredient. If the story doesn't make them want to cook it, rewrite the story.]

**Yield:** [Specific — "Serves 6 as a starter, 4 as a main"]
**Active time:** [Hands-on work only]
**Total time:** [Including resting, cooling, marinating]
**Difficulty:** [1-5: 1 = mise only, 2 = basic technique, 3 = timing matters, 4 = requires practice, 5 = you'll fail the first time]

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |

### Method

**[Component 1]:**
1. [Instruction — temperature, time, and a visual/sensory cue. Every step answers "how do I know it's done?"]
2. [Instruction]
3. [Instruction]

**[Component 2]:**
1. [Instruction]
2. [Instruction]

**To Finish:**
1. [Assembly]
2. [The last gesture — the one that elevates it]

### Why This Works (The Science)
[One technique in the recipe, explained. Not all of them — one. The one that makes the biggest difference. 2-3 sentences.]

### Yacht Adaptation
- **Prep ahead:** [What can be done 24h, 4h, 1h in advance. Be specific.]
- **Hold:** [How long it holds, how, and what degrades. Be honest — "terrible holder" is a valid answer.]
- **Motion:** [What to watch for in sea state 3+]
- **Scale:** [Up/down notes. Linear or not? Wider pot vs. deeper?]

### Plating
[2 sentences. Classic presentation. If this dish shouldn't be plated — say so.]

### Pairing
[One wine or drink. Specific producer or style. One sentence.]
