# TECHNIQUE OF THE WEEK — Template

**Voice:** A coach, not a teacher. Short sentences. Imperative mood. You're in the galley standing next to them. No theory without immediate practice.

**Rhythm:** Provoke, instruct, explain, prove. Every section earns the next. If they stop reading after "The Move," they're already better.

**Word Count:** 250-350 · **Read Time:** 1-1.5 min

## [TECHNIQUE NAME]: [Subtitle that kills a sacred cow]

**The Move:** [One sentence. What you're going to do differently starting now.]

**Do This:**
1. [Action — precise, no ambiguity. Include temperature, time, visual cue.]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]
4. [Action — maximum 5 steps. If it needs more, it's not a technique brief, it's a recipe.]

**Why It Works:**
[2-3 sentences. Name the reaction, the compound, the physics. Numbers. "Milk solids burn above 150°C. Your searing pan is at 200°C+." Not "high heat makes things brown."]

**The Variables:**

| Factor | What Happens | Adjust By |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |

**You Know It Worked When:**
[Measurable outcome. Temperature reading, visual cue, texture test, taste marker. Not "it looks good." Specific.]

**At Sea:**
[One sentence. Motion, humidity, equipment, timing — the yacht-specific consideration that separates this from a food blog.]

**Source:** [Named researcher, book, or paper.]

## Example: Reverse Basting

### Reverse Basting: Why You've Been Wasting Butter

**The Move:** Stop basting throughout. Baste only in the final 90 seconds.

**Do This:**
1. Sear your protein — steak, fish, chicken thigh — in a dry pan with neutral oil. No butter.
2. Build the crust first. Full Maillard. 2-3 minutes per side depending on thickness.
3. At 90 seconds before target doneness, add cold butter (fridge-cold, not room temp), crushed garlic, and thyme.
4. Tilt the pan 30°. Baste aggressively with a spoon for 60-90 seconds.
5. Rest immediately. The butter continues penetrating during rest.

**Why It Works:**
Milk solids in butter burn above 150°C. Your searing pan is at 200°C+. Early butter = burnt milk solids = bitter fond = ruined sauce potential. By waiting, you get Maillard browning on the protein first (requires a dry surface — butter adds moisture), then butter flavor penetration during the final baste when the pan has cooled slightly from the added cold mass. The butter reaches beurre noisette stage, not beurre noir.

**The Variables:**

| Factor | What Happens | Adjust By |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Butter temperature | Warm butter burns faster, less basting time | Always use fridge-cold |
| Pan mass | Heavy cast iron holds more heat = faster burning | Reduce heat 30 sec before adding butter |
| Protein thickness | Thicker cut = longer baste window available | For >3cm, start baste 30 sec earlier |

**You Know It Worked When:**
The butter in the pan is nutty brown (beurre noisette), not black. The fond is golden, not carbonized. If you can deglaze and make a pan sauce after, you did it right. If the fond is bitter, you started the butter too early.

**At Sea:**
Beam seas make tilting the pan harder. Use a deeper-bowled spoon, or work in shorter bursts. The rocking motion can actually help distribute butter if you time your basting to the roll.
