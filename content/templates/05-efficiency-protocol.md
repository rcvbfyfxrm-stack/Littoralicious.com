# EFFICIENCY PROTOCOL — Template

**Voice:** A systems engineer who cooks. No fluff. Problem → solution → proof. If it can't be quantified, it doesn't belong here.

**Rhythm:** Name the pain. Fix the pain. Prove you fixed it. Warn what can break. Attribute who taught you.

## [PROTOCOL NAME]
*[Category: Prep / Service / Storage / Cleanup / Provisioning / Equipment / Workflow]*

**The Pain:**
[One sentence. A specific frustration they feel daily or weekly. Not abstract — visceral.]

**The Protocol:**
1. [Action — verb first, specific, measurable]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]
4. [Action]
5. [Action — maximum 5 steps. If it needs more, split into two protocols.]

**Why It Works:**
[One paragraph. The principle — workflow science, thermodynamics, ergonomics, cognitive load reduction. Not just "it's faster." Why is it faster?]

**The Proof:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Time | [X minutes] | [Y minutes] |
| Steps/movements | [Count] | [Count] |
| Error rate | [Frequency] | [Frequency] |

**The Catch:**
[What can go wrong. When NOT to use this. An honest limitation. This builds trust.]

**Who Taught Me This:**
[A specific chef, a specific yacht, a specific disaster. Make it human.]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Solves a problem they face daily or weekly?
- [ ] Implementable today with zero new equipment?
- [ ] Includes at least one specific number (time, quantity, percentage)?
- [ ] Acknowledges a real limitation?
- [ ] Tested personally or attributed to a named source?

## Category Rotation
Cycle through to keep it fresh:
- Prep workflow (mise, batch cooking, staging)
- Station organization (zones, tray systems, labeling)
- Service timing (hold strategies, fire sequences, delay management)
- Provisioning (shopping routes, ordering systems, inventory)
- Cleaning & maintenance (equipment care, deep clean protocols)
- Storage (vacuum sealing, rotation, small-space solutions)
- Crew integration (communication systems, handoff protocols)
- Waste reduction (trim utilization, portion control, stock cycling)

## Example: The Mise Tray Reset

### The Mise Tray Reset
*Category: Prep / Service*

**The Pain:**
You're rebuilding your mise en place from scratch between lunch and dinner, pulling the same containers from the same spots, wasting 20 minutes you don't have while the stew asks why lunch isn't cleared yet.

**The Protocol:**
1. Designate one sheet tray per service type (lunch mise, dinner mise, dessert mise)
2. At the end of prep, arrange all service-ready containers on that tray in plating order — left to right matches your plating sequence
3. Wrap the entire tray in film and refrigerate as a single unit
4. At service: pull one tray. Your station is set in 30 seconds.
5. After service: refill containers, rewrap, return. Tomorrow's prep is half done.

**Why It Works:**
You're batching the cognitive load of "what do I need and where is it" into prep time, when you're not under service pressure. The tray becomes a physical checklist — if a container is missing, you see the gap immediately. Your brain makes zero decisions during setup. Zero decisions = zero mistakes = faster service start.

**The Proof:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Service setup time | 15-20 min | 30 seconds |
| Daily time saved (2 transitions) | — | 30-40 minutes |
| Missing component errors | 2-3 per week | Near zero (gap = visible) |

**The Catch:**
Requires fridge space for full trays. On yachts under 40m, you'll need half-trays or creative stacking. Also requires discipline — if someone grabs a container and doesn't return it to the tray, the system breaks. Brief the stew team. Make it law.

**Who Taught Me This:**
The chef on *Vava II* fed 52 crew plus 12 guests. She had 9 trays in rotation. I watched her set up for a 7-course dinner in under 2 minutes. "If you're thinking during service," she said, "you already lost."
