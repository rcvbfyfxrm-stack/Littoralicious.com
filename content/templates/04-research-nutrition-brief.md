## [HEADLINE: Plain statement of finding — what the research showed, not what you wish it showed]

**The Study:**
[One paragraph. Who (institution), what (study type: RCT, meta-analysis, observational, systematic review), where (journal, year), how big (n=participants or studies). This is the credibility paragraph.]

**Key Finding:**
[One sentence. Plain language. The main takeaway.]

**The Numbers:**

| Finding | Data | Context |
|---------|------|---------|
| [Specific finding] | [Number, percentage, measurement] | [Why this matters practically] |
| [Finding 2] | [Data] | [Context] |

**What This Means in the Galley:**
[2-3 sentences. Translate to action. How does this change what they do tomorrow? Be concrete — name a dish, a technique, a decision point.]

**What This Does Not Mean:**
[1-2 sentences. The overclaim people will make. Kill it before it spreads.]

**Limitations:**
- [Limitation 1 — sample size, population, methodology, industry funding]
- [Limitation 2 — what the study didn't test]

**Your Move:**
[One sentence. One action. Or: "No action needed — this confirms what you're already doing."]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Study is peer-reviewed?
- [ ] Published within last 3 years (unless foundational)?
- [ ] Limitations stated honestly?
- [ ] No health claims beyond what the study supports?
- [ ] "What This Does Not Mean" section is included?

## Rotating Topics
- Cooking chemistry (oil stability, protein denaturation, Maillard)
- Bioactive compounds in food (polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids)
- Food safety updates (HACCP-relevant)
- Nutrition science (with caveats)
- Ingredient storage research
- Fermentation and microbiome
- Sustainability and sourcing

## Red Lines

## Example: EVOO Frying Stability

### Extra Virgin Olive Oil Remains Stable at Frying Temperatures

**The Study:**
A 2024 systematic review from the University of Barcelona, published in *Food Research International*, analyzed 36 studies on EVOO behavior during cooking — frying, sautéing, roasting — across temperatures from 120°C to 240°C. Total sample: 2,847 oil samples.

**Key Finding:**
Extra virgin olive oil is more thermally stable than previously believed, outperforming seed oils due to its high antioxidant content and low polyunsaturated fat ratio.

**The Numbers:**

| Finding | Data | Context |
|---------|------|---------|
| Actual smoke point range | 190-215°C (varies by quality) | Higher than the 160°C "rule" commonly cited |
| Polar compound formation | 23% lower than sunflower oil at same temp | Polar compounds = degradation markers |
| Antioxidant retention | 50-70% retained after 30 min at 180°C | Polyphenols survive far better than assumed |

**What This Means in the Galley:**
Sauté and pan-fry with good EVOO. The "save it for finishing only" advice was always overcautious — now the data confirms it. Use it for searing fish, sweating aromatics, pan-frying vegetables. You get flavor and stability.

**What This Does Not Mean:**
Deep-frying at 180°C for extended periods (30+ minutes continuous) is still better done with refined oils. This research covers typical sauté and pan-fry durations.

**Limitations:**
- Most studies used controlled lab conditions; a yacht galley with salt air adds variables
- Quality matters — low-grade "EVOO" (often mislabeled) showed faster degradation
- Reusing oil across multiple services wasn't thoroughly addressed

**Your Move:**
Stop reaching for "cooking olive oil." Use your good EVOO for sautéing. The flavor payoff is real and the science supports the stability.
