## [HEADLINE: Plain statement of finding — what the research showed, not what you wish it showed]

**The Study:**
[One paragraph. Who (institution), what (study type: RCT, meta-analysis, observational, systematic review), where (journal, year), how big (n=participants or studies). This is the credibility paragraph.]

**Key Finding:**
[One sentence. Plain language. The main takeaway.]

**The Numbers:**

| Finding | Data | Context |
|---------|------|---------|
| [Specific finding] | [Number, percentage, measurement] | [Why this matters practically] |
| [Finding 2] | [Data] | [Context] |

**What This Means in the Galley:**
[2-3 sentences. Translate to action. How does this change what they do tomorrow? Be concrete — name a dish, a technique, a decision point.]

**What This Does Not Mean:**
[1-2 sentences. The overclaim people will make. Kill it before it spreads.]

**Limitations:**
- [Limitation 1 — sample size, population, methodology, industry funding]
- [Limitation 2 — what the study didn't test]

**Your Move:**
[One sentence. One action. Or: "No action needed — this confirms what you're already doing."]
