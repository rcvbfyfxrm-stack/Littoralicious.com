# INGREDIENT SPOTLIGHT — Template

**Voice:** A love letter written by a scientist. Reverent but not romantic. You're introducing the reader to something they think they know — then proving they don't.

**Rhythm:** Open with a number that stops them. Go deep on one thing. End with something they'll try tonight.

## [INGREDIENT NAME]
*[Latin name] · [Origin region] · [Peak season]*

**[NUMBER].** [One-sentence fact that reframes everything. A number, a historical detail, a chemical truth that earns the next paragraph.]

**What It Actually Is:**
[2-3 sentences. Botanical or zoological reality. What part of what organism. What process creates the flavor you know. Not Wikipedia — the details a chef should be embarrassed not to know.]

**The Story That Sticks:**
[One paragraph. A person, a place, a moment in time. Not "it was traded along the Silk Road" — who traded it, why, what happened when it arrived. A funeral, a war, a monopoly, a grandmother. Something they'll retell.]

**The Compound That Matters:**

| Compound | Also Found In | What It Does |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| [Primary aroma/flavor compound] | [2-3 surprising foods] | [Flavor effect + any bioactive role] |
| [Secondary compound] | [2-3 foods] | [Effect] |

**Three Pairings You Haven't Tried:**
*Based on shared volatile compounds (VCF database / Foodpairing analysis):*

1. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [One sentence on why it works and how to use it.]
2. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [Application.]
3. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [Application.]

**Sourcing:**
- [What to look for: color, texture, smell]
- [What to avoid: specific red flags]
- [The difference between good and great (and whether great is worth it)]

**On Board:**
- **Storage:** [Temperature, wrapping, container — for yacht conditions, not a restaurant walk-in]
- **Shelf life:** [Honest, not packaging claims]
- **The move:** [One preparation in 3-4 sentences. Not a full recipe — an idea. Something unexpected that takes under 5 minutes and makes guests remember you.]

**Source:** [Named reference — book, database, researcher]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Opening fact genuinely surprises (not "did you know vanilla is expensive")?
- [ ] Story has a human name or specific place?
- [ ] At least one pairing they've never seen?
- [ ] Compound data is verifiable?
- [ ] Storage advice accounts for 30°C+ galley + humidity?
