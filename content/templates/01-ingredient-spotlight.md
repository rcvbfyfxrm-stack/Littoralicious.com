# INGREDIENT SPOTLIGHT — Template

**Voice:** A love letter written by a scientist. Reverent but not romantic. You're introducing the reader to something they think they know — then proving they don't.

**Rhythm:** Open with a number that stops them. Go deep on one thing. End with something they'll try tonight.

## [INGREDIENT NAME]
*[Latin name] · [Origin region] · [Peak season]*

**[NUMBER].** [One-sentence fact that reframes everything. A number, a historical detail, a chemical truth that earns the next paragraph.]

**What It Actually Is:**
[2-3 sentences. Botanical or zoological reality. What part of what organism. What process creates the flavor you know. Not Wikipedia — the details a chef should be embarrassed not to know.]

**The Story That Sticks:**
[One paragraph. A person, a place, a moment in time. Not "it was traded along the Silk Road" — who traded it, why, what happened when it arrived. A funeral, a war, a monopoly, a grandmother. Something they'll retell.]

**The Compound That Matters:**

| Compound | Also Found In | What It Does |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| [Primary aroma/flavor compound] | [2-3 surprising foods] | [Flavor effect + any bioactive role] |
| [Secondary compound] | [2-3 foods] | [Effect] |

**Three Pairings You Haven't Tried:**
*Based on shared volatile compounds (VCF database / Foodpairing analysis):*

1. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [One sentence on why it works and how to use it.]
2. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [Application.]
3. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [Application.]

**Sourcing:**
- [What to look for: color, texture, smell]
- [What to avoid: specific red flags]
- [The difference between good and great (and whether great is worth it)]

**On Board:**
- **Storage:** [Temperature, wrapping, container — for yacht conditions, not a restaurant walk-in]
- **Shelf life:** [Honest, not packaging claims]
- **The move:** [One preparation in 3-4 sentences. Not a full recipe — an idea. Something unexpected that takes under 5 minutes and makes guests remember you.]

**Source:** [Named reference — book, database, researcher]

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Opening fact genuinely surprises (not "did you know vanilla is expensive")?
- [ ] Story has a human name or specific place?
- [ ] At least one pairing they've never seen?
- [ ] Compound data is verifiable?
- [ ] Storage advice accounts for 30°C+ galley + humidity?

## Example: Bottarga

**Bottarga**
*Mugil cephalus roe · Sardinia, Mauritania, Taiwan · Year-round (best: late summer)*

**700g.** That's what the 200g piece in your hand weighed before three months of salt and air reduced it to concentrated marine umami. A single bottarga from Cabras, Sardinia loses 70% of its original weight. You're holding the essence of what used to be an entire roe sac.

**What It Actually Is:**
The salted, pressed, and dried roe sac of grey mullet (less commonly, tuna). The membrane holds thousands of eggs together, creating that firm-yet-waxy texture. It's fish charcuterie — preservation through salt and dehydration, concentrating glutamates into something you can grate like Parmesan.

**The Story That Sticks:**
Phoenician traders carried bottarga across the Mediterranean 3,000 years ago — shelf-stable protein that survived months at sea. The name comes from Arabic *batarikh*, "pickled fish eggs." The Sardinian town of Cabras has produced it the same way since at least the 10th century. When a Cabras family's bottarga matriarch dies, the funeral is attended by rival producers taking mental notes on her technique. The secret, apparently, dies with each one. And yet every family claims theirs is the original.

**The Compound That Matters:**

| Compound | Also Found In | What It Does |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| TMAO (trimethylamine oxide) | All seafood, concentrated here | Marine, briny depth — the "sea" you taste |
| Free glutamates | Parmesan, soy sauce, kombu | Umami — why it works grated over pasta |
| Oleic acid | Olive oil, avocado | Rich, coating mouthfeel that lingers |

**Three Pairings You Haven't Tried:**

1. **Bottarga + Grapefruit** — Both contain nootkatone. The citrus cuts the salt while harmonizing aromatics. Shave bottarga over supremed grapefruit with mint oil.
2. **Bottarga + Celery** — Shared phthalides create a green, savory bridge. Classic Sardinian — raw celery, thin bottarga shavings, lemon, oil. Three minutes, unforgettable.
3. **Bottarga + White Chocolate** — Both rich in oleic acid. Sounds insane. Works as an amuse: paper-thin shaving on a white chocolate disc with Maldon salt.

**Sourcing:**
- **Color:** Amber to deep orange (grey mullet); darker burgundy (tuna). Avoid pale or grey spots.
- **Texture:** Firm but slightly yielding. Rock hard = over-dried.
- **Smell:** Clean sea breeze. If it smells fishy or ammoniac, walk away.
- **Good vs. great:** Sardinian (Cabras) is the benchmark. Mauritanian is cheaper, perfectly usable. The $20 difference per piece is noticeable but not transformative.

**On Board:**
- **Storage:** Vacuum-sealed, 4°C, dark. Opened: wrap in wax paper, then plastic, then foil. Refrigerate obsessively.
- **Shelf life:** Unopened, vacuum-sealed: 6+ months. Opened: 3-4 weeks if wrapped properly.
- **The move:** Forget pasta. Shave bottarga paper-thin over room-temperature burrata, add a thread of honey, cracked black pepper, and your best olive oil. Warm bread. Three minutes. Guests will bring it up six months later.
