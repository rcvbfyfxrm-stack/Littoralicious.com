# Fish Fabrication: Real Yield Numbers

Textbook yield percentages are lies. They're calculated from idealized fish under controlled conditions by people optimizing for data, not dinner service.

Here are the numbers from actual fabrication—accounting for seasonal fat content, wild vs. farmed variability, and the cuts guests actually want.

## How to Read This

**Whole to skin-on fillet:** What you get after gutting, scaling, and filleting. Includes pin bones.

**Whole to portion-ready:** What you get after portioning, skinning (if applicable), and removing all bones. This is what goes on the plate.

**Notes:** What affects yield beyond the species itself.

## Mediterranean Species

### Sea Bass (Branzino/Loup de Mer)

| Cut | Yield (Wild) | Yield (Farmed) |
|-----|--------------|----------------|
| Whole to skin-on fillet | 42-45% | 45-48% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 35-38% | 38-42% |

**Notes:** Farmed fish have higher fat content and more consistent sizing. Wild specimens show 5-8% yield variation based on season—lowest in late winter after spawning.

### Gilt-head Bream (Dorade)

| Cut | Yield (Wild) | Yield (Farmed) |
|-----|--------------|----------------|
| Whole to skin-on fillet | 38-42% | 42-45% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 32-35% | 36-40% |

**Notes:** Thick scales require aggressive scaling or yield suffers. Account for 2-3% loss to scale removal. Head constitutes 25% of total weight—save for stock.

### Red Mullet (Rouget)

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to skin-on fillet | 48-52% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 40-44% |

**Notes:** Exceptionally high yield due to small head relative to body. Liver is prized—adds 2-3% to usable yield if serving it.

## Atlantic Species

### Dover Sole

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to on-the-bone | 85% (just gutted) |
| Whole to 4 fillets | 45-48% |
| Whole to skinned fillets | 38-42% |

**Notes:** Most valuable served whole on the bone. Skinning loses significant usable fish. Dark skin removes easier than white—do dark side first.

### Turbot

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to on-the-bone | 80% |
| Whole to 4 fillets | 52-55% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 45-48% |

**Notes:** Highest yield of flatfish due to thick fillets. Frame makes exceptional stock—worth saving. Collar meat adds 3-4% if you extract it.

### John Dory (Saint-Pierre)

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to fillets | 30-35% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 25-30% |

**Notes:** Punishing yield due to massive head. Priced accordingly. Never buy by the kilo without calculating portion cost. Frame too gelatinous for most stocks.

## Tropical/Caribbean Species

### Mahi-Mahi

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to skin-on fillet | 48-52% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 40-45% |

**Notes:** Yield varies dramatically with size. Fish under 5kg yield 5-8% less. Bloodline must be removed completely—accounts for 3-4% loss.

### Yellowfin Tuna

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to loins | 55-60% |
| Loins to sashimi-grade portions | 75-80% |
| Whole to plate-ready | 45-48% |

**Notes:** Sinew between loins reduces yield if removed (recommended for sashimi, optional for seared). Belly yields are separate—15-18% additional.

### Wahoo

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to skin-on fillet | 55-58% |
| Whole to portion-ready | 48-52% |

**Notes:** Excellent yield. Skin is thin and edible when properly seared—consider leaving on for 3-4% yield recovery. Flesh dry-ages well; day 2-3 improves texture.

## High-Value Species

### Lobster (European)

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to tail + claw meat | 28-32% |
| Whole to all usable meat | 35-38% |

**Notes:** Knuckle meat adds 5-7% if extracted. Shell weight accounts for 55-60%. Tomally and coral add 2-3% if using. Size matters: 600g lobsters yield 3-4% better than 400g.

### Langoustine

| Cut | Yield |
|-----|-------|
| Whole to tail meat | 30-35% |
| Head meat extraction | +5-7% |

**Notes:** Served in shell for visual impact sacrifices no yield. Head contains prized fat—communicate to guests or save for bisque. Grade (size) dramatically affects yield.

## Cost Calculation Framework

**Step 1:** Determine portion size (typically 150-180g for fish main course)

**Step 2:** Calculate required whole fish weight:
```
Whole fish needed = Portion size ÷ Yield percentage
```

**Example:** 160g branzino portion, 38% yield
```
160g ÷ 0.38 = 421g whole fish needed
```

**Step 3:** Apply cost:
```
Portion cost = Whole fish weight × Price per kg
421g × €18/kg = €7.58 per portion
```

**Step 4:** Add waste handling:
- Frames for stock: Reduces effective cost by 10-15%
- Trim for staff meal: Value neutral but affects provisioning

## Seasonal Adjustments

| Season | Yield Impact | Reason |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Pre-spawn | +2-5% | Fat accumulation |
| Post-spawn | -5-8% | Depleted condition |
| Summer | Baseline | Standard condition |
| Winter (cold water) | +3-4% | Fat storage |

## Provisioning Math

For a 10-guest dinner with fish main course:

1. Decide species and portion size
2. Calculate whole fish needed (yield %)
3. Add 10% contingency for variable fish quality
4. Round up to whole fish
5. Account for any no-fish dietary requirements

**Example:** 10 guests, turbot, 180g portions, 1 pescatarian exception

```
9 portions × 180g = 1,620g needed
1,620g ÷ 0.48 yield = 3,375g whole fish
3,375g × 1.10 contingency = 3,712g
Round to available sizes: Order 4kg turbot
```
