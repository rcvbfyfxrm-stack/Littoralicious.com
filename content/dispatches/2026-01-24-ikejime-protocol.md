The JIF has revised its recommended bleeding time for Pacific bluefin from 45 to 62 minutes based on ATP degradation studies. The extended window allows for more complete inosine monophosphate development—the compound responsible for peak umami in aged fish.

Chefs should note this applies only to fish destined for 72+ hour aging. For same-day service, the traditional 45-minute protocol remains optimal.
