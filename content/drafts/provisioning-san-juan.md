# San Juan Provisioning: The Caribbean Gateway Guide

**US territory pricing. Caribbean location. No import duties from the mainland. Here's how to provision smart in Puerto Rico.**

San Juan is the easiest Caribbean provision. You are in a US territory — same suppliers, same brands, same payment systems, no customs headaches bringing food from the mainland. But you are also in the Caribbean, which means local produce, tropical ingredients, and rum distilleries that put anything stateside to shame.

The catch: no Restaurant Depot. The workaround: Costco and Sam's Club are everywhere, and local suppliers fill the gaps. Here is the complete breakdown.

## Marinas & Logistics

### Where Yachts Dock

| Marina | Capacity | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Safe Harbor San Juan** | Up to 450 ft | Piers 9 & 10, Old San Juan | New facility (2024), megayacht capable |
| **Club Nautico de San Juan** | 30-250 ft | Metro San Juan | 117 slips, central location |
| **San Juan Bay Marina** | Up to 160 ft | Isla Grande | US Customs on-site |
| **Safe Harbor Puerto del Rey** | Megayacht | Fajardo (45 min east) | Caribbean's largest marina |

### Delivery & Transport

**Uber/Lyft:** Fully operational throughout San Juan metro. XL available for larger orders.

**Local couriers:** Most suppliers deliver direct to marinas with minimum orders.

**Import note:** Puerto Rico is US territory — no duties on goods from mainland. **However:** When leaving PR, USDA restricts most fresh produce. Check before provisioning for departure.

## Sustainability Notes

**Buy local:**
- Puerto Rican grass-fed beef (CaboRojo Steaks)
- Local seasonal fish from small boats
- Organic produce from Mercado Agrícola Natural farmers

**Avoid:**
- Queen conch (heavily regulated)
- Spiny lobster outside season (Aug 1 - Mar 31)
- Imported fish when local is available

---

## The Bottom Line

San Juan combines US convenience with Caribbean character. No import duties. Costco and Sam's for bulk. Exceptional local ingredients that mainlanders pay premium prices for. Ron del Barrilito in the bar.

On a typical $5,000 provision, self-sourcing in San Juan saves $800-1,200 versus chandler pricing — and you get better quality because you are selecting it yourself.

Build relationships with Alan's Market for seafood and CUT Butcher Shop for meat. Learn Rio Piedras Market for produce. The rest fills in around those three.
