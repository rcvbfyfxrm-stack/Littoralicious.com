# Sea Urchin Beurre Blanc: The Natural Emulsifier You're Not Using

**The Move:** Use raw sea urchin roe to stabilise a beurre blanc — no cream, no starch, no lecithin. The roe's proteins and lipids do the work while its glutamic acid turns the sauce into an umami amplifier.

**Do This:**
1. Build a standard beurre blanc reduction: 100 ml dry white wine, 50 ml white wine vinegar, 1 minced shallot. Reduce to 2 tablespoons of syrupy liquid. Strain.
2. Over low heat, mount 200 g cold unsalted butter, cubed, whisking continuously. Add a few cubes at a time. Sauce should be creamy and opaque, not separated. Hold between 55–60°C.
3. Remove from heat. Add 50 g fresh sea urchin roe. Blend with an immersion blender for 10 seconds — no more. The roe should integrate into a smooth, coral-coloured emulsion.
4. Season with fine sea salt and a few drops of lemon juice. Serve immediately over pan-seared white fish, spooned — not poured.

**Why It Works:**
Sea urchin roe is approximately 15% protein and up to 20% lipid at pre-spawning peak. When blended into a warm butter sauce, the roe's proteins (primarily phospholipid-rich lipoproteins) position themselves at the oil-water interface, stabilising the emulsion the same way egg yolk stabilises hollandaise. The high concentration of free glutamic acid — one of the richest natural sources — simultaneously amplifies the sauce's savoury depth without adding any identifiable "fishy" flavour. The mechanism is additive: butter's diacetyl meets the roe's glutamate meets the reduction's acidity.

**The Variables:**

| Factor | What Happens | Adjust By |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Temperature above 65°C | Roe proteins tighten, texture turns grainy, colour dulls | Always blend off heat. If sauce is too hot, let it drop to 58°C before adding roe |
| Roe quality | Watery or stale roe breaks the emulsion and adds bitterness | Use only firm, fresh, deep-orange roe. No frozen. |
| Acid balance | Too much reduction = roe flavour masked; too little = sauce is flat | Taste after blending. Adjust with drops of lemon, not more vinegar |
| Blending time | Over-blending incorporates air and thins the sauce | 10 seconds maximum. You want integration, not aeration |

**You Know It Worked When:**
The sauce is a uniform coral-orange, coats the back of a spoon without running, and tastes like butter and ocean in the same breath. No graininess on the tongue. Holds for 15–20 minutes in a bain-marie at 55°C without breaking.

**At Sea:**
This sauce does not hold well for extended service — 20 minutes maximum. Build it to order or in small batches. The roe is the perishable link; have it shucked and ready at your station, on ice.
