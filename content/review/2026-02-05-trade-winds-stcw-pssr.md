# STCW Anti-Harassment Training Now Mandatory — What Yacht Chefs Need to Know

*February 2026 · Global — All Flag States*

**The Development:**
As of January 1, 2026, all seafarers completing or renewing STCW Basic Safety Training must be certified under updated PSSR (Personal Safety and Social Responsibilities) standards. The amendments, adopted by the IMO, add mandatory training modules covering recognition, prevention, and response to violence and harassment at sea — including sexual harassment, bullying, discriminatory behaviour, and sexual assault. The update introduces the "continuum of harm" concept and codifies bystander responsibilities for the first time in maritime training.

**Who's Affected:**
Every yacht chef entering the industry or renewing their STCW certification. If you're completing Basic Safety Training from January 2026 onward, the updated PSSR module is now part of your required coursework. Existing certificated seafarers are not required to retake PSSR, but the MCA strongly recommends that all management companies provide updated training to current crew.

**What It Means:**
This is the most significant crew welfare regulation change in years. For yacht chefs specifically — who work in confined environments, under high pressure, often as the only person in their department — the training addresses scenarios that are structurally familiar: isolated working conditions, power dynamics with senior officers, and the blurred boundaries of living aboard. Captains and DPAs must now revise their Safety Management Systems to incorporate these policies. If your vessel's SMS hasn't been updated since December 2025, it's non-compliant.

**Key Details:**

| Detail | Specifics |
|--------|-----------|
| Effective date | January 1, 2026 |
| Applies to | All new STCW Basic Safety Training and PSSR renewals |
| Cost | Included in standard STCW course fees (no additional charge) |
| Existing crew | Not required to retake, but MCA recommends company-provided refresher training |
| SMS update deadline | Immediate — vessels should have updated policies in place now |
| Flag state enforcement | All IMO member states; MCA, Marshall Islands, Cayman Islands confirmed compliant |

**Your Move:**
If you're renewing your STCW this year, the updated module is automatic — no action needed beyond enrolling in a current course. If you renewed in 2025 or earlier, ask your management company whether they're providing the updated training. If you're a sole chef reporting to a captain who hasn't mentioned this, raise it. The regulation exists because the problem exists.
