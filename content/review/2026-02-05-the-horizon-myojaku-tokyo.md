# Myojaku Earns Three Michelin Stars — A Chef Who Stripped Umami Back to the Source

*February 2026 · Tokyo, Japan*

**What Happened:**
Chef Hidetoshi Nakamura's Myojaku was elevated to Three Michelin Stars in the 2026 Tokyo guide — the only new three-star restaurant in this edition. The restaurant opened in 2022, earned its first star in 2023, and has now reached the top tier in under four years. Tokyo retains the most starred restaurants of any city on earth: 160 total, with 18 newly recognised in this edition.

**Who:**
Nakamura built his cooking philosophy on a single, specific rejection: he minimises traditional dashi — the kelp-and-bonito stock that is the foundation of virtually all Japanese cuisine. Instead, he centres his cooking on the natural flavours of individual ingredients and the character of submarine groundwater. In a cuisine where dashi is considered non-negotiable, this is not rebellion — it's a precise, technically demanding alternative that forces every ingredient to stand on its own umami.

**Why This Matters:**
In a week where we're talking about umami — what it is, where it comes from, how to build it — Nakamura is the living counterargument to stacking. Most chefs (ourselves included, in the Evidence section) think about umami as additive: more glutamate sources, more depth. Nakamura's approach is subtractive. Strip away the stock. Let the ingredient's own glutamic acid speak. It's the difference between amplification and revelation — and the Michelin inspectors just confirmed that both paths lead to three stars.

**The Detail Worth Knowing:**
The Michelin Guide also honoured 97-year-old Kenjiro Kanemoto of Nodaiwa Azabu Iikura Honten with the Mentor Chef Award — the world's oldest active Michelin-recognised chef. A man who has been cooking eel in the same way, in the same place, for longer than most of us have been alive. Two stories from the same guide: radical minimalism and absolute tradition. Both awarded. Both earned.
