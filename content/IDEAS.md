## PROVISIONING GUIDES

### Miami / Fort Lauderdale Provisioning Hack
**Status:** Research needed
**Priority:** High

The Uber pickup strategy:
- Identify best quality/price shops in Miami/Fort Lauderdale region
- Compare: Shop prices + Uber pickup vs. Chandler delivery fees
- Research shops that allow direct ordering
- Calculate break-even point (when Uber is cheaper than delivery)

**To research:**
- [ ] Restaurant Depot (membership required?)
- [ ] Costco Business Center locations
- [ ] Local fish markets (prices vs. chandler markup)
- [ ] Specialty stores (cheeses, charcuterie)
- [ ] Uber XL rates for large orders
- [ ] Compare with typical chandler delivery fees (usually 15-25% markup)

**Article structure:**
1. The math: When Uber beats delivery
2. Shop-by-shop breakdown (quality rating, price rating, specialty)
3. Ordering tips (call ahead, specify yacht provisioning)
4. Uber logistics (timing, vehicle size, cooler requirements)
5. What to NEVER Uber (fragile items, time-sensitive)

## SUSTAINABILITY

### Sustainable Sourcing on Yachts — Golden Rules
**Status:** To write
**Priority:** High

Create both:
1. Full article with research and citations
2. One-page "Golden Rules" presentation sheet (printable, frameable for galley)

**Golden Rules framework:**
1. **Source Local First** — Every port is an opportunity
2. **Know Your Fishmonger** — Ask about catch methods, not just freshness
3. **Seasonal Thinking** — The menu follows the market, not the other way
4. **Waste Hierarchy** — Reduce > Reuse > Recycle > Dispose
5. **Certification Awareness** — MSC, ASC, what they mean, what they miss
6. **Carbon Consciousness** — Air freight vs. local (the uncomfortable math)
7. **Guest Education** — Making sustainability part of the experience
8. **Supplier Relationships** — Long-term over transactional
9. **Documentation** — Track what you source, build data
10. **Continuous Improvement** — Better each charter, not perfect immediately

**Design for presentation sheet:**
- Clean, minimal
- Print-ready (A4 and Letter)
- Laminate-friendly
- Could hang in galley as reminder

**Research needed:**
- [ ] MSC/ASC certification data
- [ ] Carbon footprint comparisons (local vs. imported seafood)
- [ ] Case studies from sustainable-focused yachts
- [ ] Guest perception research
- [ ] Provisioning cost comparison (sustainable vs. conventional)
