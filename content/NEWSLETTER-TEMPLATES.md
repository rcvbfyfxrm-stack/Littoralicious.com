# LITTORALICIOUS — Newsletter Templates

**The Weekly Dispatch**
Five sections. Five minutes. Every Sunday at 07:00 UTC.

Each section is its own voice, its own rhythm, its own reason to exist. They don't blend — they contrast. A reader should feel the shift between sections like changing courses.

---

## 1. INGREDIENT SPOTLIGHT

### The Voice
A love letter written by a scientist. Reverent but not romantic. You're introducing the reader to something they think they know — then proving they don't.

### The Rhythm
Open with a number that stops them. Go deep on one thing. End with something they'll try tonight.

### Template

---

**[INGREDIENT NAME]**
*[Latin name] · [Origin region] · [Peak season]*

**[NUMBER].** [One-sentence fact that reframes everything. A number, a historical detail, a chemical truth that earns the next paragraph.]

> *Example: "A single Sardinian bottarga loses 70% of its weight during curing. The 200g piece in your hand started as 700g of living roe."*
> *Example: "Saffron requires 150,000 hand-picked flowers per kilo. It's been the most expensive spice on earth for 3,000 uninterrupted years."*

**What It Actually Is:**
[2-3 sentences. Botanical or zoological reality. What part of what organism. What process creates the flavor you know. Not Wikipedia — the details a chef should be embarrassed not to know.]

**The Story That Sticks:**
[One paragraph. A person, a place, a moment in time. Not "it was traded along the Silk Road" — who traded it, why, what happened when it arrived. A funeral, a war, a monopoly, a grandmother. Something they'll retell.]

**The Compound That Matters:**

| Compound | Also Found In | What It Does |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| [Primary aroma/flavor compound] | [2-3 surprising foods] | [Flavor effect + any bioactive role] |
| [Secondary compound] | [2-3 foods] | [Effect] |

**Three Pairings You Haven't Tried:**
*Based on shared volatile compounds (VCF database / Foodpairing analysis):*

1. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [One sentence on why it works and how to use it.]
2. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [Application.]
3. **[Ingredient] + [Surprise]** — [Shared compound]. [Application.]

**Sourcing:**
- [What to look for: color, texture, smell]
- [What to avoid: specific red flags]
- [The difference between good and great (and whether great is worth it)]

**On Board:**
- **Storage:** [Temperature, wrapping, container — for yacht conditions, not a restaurant walk-in]
- **Shelf life:** [Honest, not packaging claims]
- **The move:** [One preparation in 3-4 sentences. Not a full recipe — an idea. Something unexpected that takes under 5 minutes and makes guests remember you.]

**Source:** [Named reference — book, database, researcher]

---

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Opening fact genuinely surprises (not "did you know vanilla is expensive")?
- [ ] Story has a human name or specific place?
- [ ] At least one pairing they've never seen?
- [ ] Compound data is verifiable?

## 2. TECHNIQUE OF THE WEEK

### The Voice
A coach, not a teacher. Short sentences. Imperative mood. You're in the galley standing next to them. No theory without immediate practice.

### The Rhythm
Provoke, instruct, explain, prove. Every section earns the next. If they stop reading after "The Move," they're already better.

### Template

---

**[TECHNIQUE NAME]: [Subtitle that kills a sacred cow]**

> *Example: "Reverse Basting: Why You've Been Wasting Butter"*
> *Example: "The 10-Minute Garlic Rule: Crush It. Wait. Then Cook."*
> *Example: "Dry-Brining: Salt It Naked, 45 Minutes, No Excuses"*

**The Move:** [One sentence. What you're going to do differently starting now.]

> *Example: "Stop basting throughout. Baste only in the final 90 seconds."*

**Do This:**
1. [Action — precise, no ambiguity. Include temperature, time, visual cue.]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]
4. [Action — maximum 5 steps. If it needs more, it's not a hack, it's a recipe.]

**Why It Works:**
[2-3 sentences. Name the reaction, the compound, the physics. Numbers. "Milk solids burn above 150°C. Your searing pan is at 200°C+." Not "high heat makes things brown."]

**The Variables:**

| Factor | What Happens | Adjust By |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |
| [Variable] | [Effect] | [Compensation] |

**You Know It Worked When:**
[Measurable outcome. Temperature reading, visual cue, texture test, taste marker. Not "it looks good." Specific.]

**At Sea:**
[One sentence. Motion, humidity, equipment, timing — the yacht-specific consideration that separates this from a food blog.]

**Source:** [Named researcher, book, or paper. Not "the internet."]

---

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Can be executed during service, not just during prep?
- [ ] At least one specific number (temp, time, ratio, percentage)?
- [ ] Names the scientific principle by name?
- [ ] Kills a common myth or corrects a widespread mistake?
- [ ] Works in a galley that's moving?

## 3. LITTORAL RECIPE

### The Voice
A grandmother who happens to have a chemistry degree. Warm but precise. Opinionated. This is not a recipe — it's a short story with ingredients.

### The Rhythm
Make them care about the dish before they read a single ingredient. The story earns the recipe. The science earns the technique. The yacht adaptation earns their trust.

### Template

---

**[RECIPE NAME]**
*[Original language name if different]*

**[Region], [Coast]** — [One sentence that places this dish in the world. Not a country — a coastline, a port, a village.]

> *Example: "The fishing villages between Collioure and Cerbère, French Catalonia — where Spain starts to bleed into France and nobody agrees which language the fish speak."*
> *Example: "Olhão, Algarve — where a fisherman's widow made this with whatever the boats couldn't sell at morning market."*

**The Story:**
[One paragraph. Who makes this, when, and why it exists. A person, not a population. A moment, not a century. The reader should care about the dish before they see a single ingredient. If the story doesn't make them want to cook it, rewrite the story.]

**Yield:** [Specific — "Serves 6 as a starter, 4 as a main"]
**Active time:** [Hands-on work only]
**Total time:** [Including resting, cooling, marinating]
**Difficulty:** [1-5: 1 = mise only, 2 = basic technique, 3 = timing matters, 4 = requires practice, 5 = you'll fail the first time]

### Ingredients

**[Component 1 name]:**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| [Item] | [Precise amount, metric] | [Sourcing note, substitution, or "non-negotiable"] |
| [Item] | [Amount] | [Note] |

**[Component 2 name]:**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| [Item] | [Amount] | [Note] |

**To Finish:**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| [Item] | [Amount] | [Note] |

### Method

**[Component 1]:**
1. [Instruction — temperature, time, and a visual/sensory cue. Every step answers "how do I know it's done?"]
2. [Instruction]
3. [Instruction]

**[Component 2]:**
1. [Instruction]
2. [Instruction]

**To Finish:**
1. [Assembly]
2. [The last gesture — the one that elevates it]

### Why This Works (The Science)
[One technique in the recipe, explained. Not all of them — one. The one that makes the biggest difference. 2-3 sentences. This is why the recipe exists in the newsletter and not just in a cookbook.]

> *Example: "The layering isn't tradition for tradition's sake. Potatoes on the bottom protect delicate fish from direct heat. Gelatinous fish on top releases collagen, enriching the broth without separate stock. The no-stirring rule preserves the fish — you're braising, not making soup."*

### Yacht Adaptation
- **Prep ahead:** [What can be done 24h, 4h, 1h in advance. Be specific.]
- **Hold:** [How long it holds, how, and what degrades. Be honest — "terrible holder" is a valid answer.]
- **Motion:** [What to watch for in sea state 3+]
- **Scale:** [Up/down notes. Linear or not? Wider pot vs. deeper?]

### Plating
[2 sentences. Classic presentation. If this dish shouldn't be plated — say so. "Don't. Serve from the pot with crusty bread." is better than a forced fine-dining adaptation.]

### Pairing
[One wine or drink. Specific producer or style. One sentence.]

---

- Traditional (adapted from tradition, not invented)
- Has a story worth telling
- Achievable in a yacht galley
- Tastes better than the effort required

## 4. RESEARCH & NUTRITION BRIEF

### The Voice
A translator between science and the kitchen. Clinical precision, practical language. You read the paper so they don't have to. No hype, no fear, no "superfoods."

### The Rhythm
What did they find → Why should you care → What should you do → What should you not overclaim. Fast.

### Template

---

**[HEADLINE: Plain statement of finding — what the research showed, not what you wish it showed]**

> *Example: "Extra Virgin Olive Oil Remains Stable at Frying Temperatures"*
> *Example: "Saffron at 30mg/Day Matches Fluoxetine for Mild Depression in Six Trials"*
> *Example: "Crushing Garlic and Waiting 10 Minutes Produces Measurably More Bioactive Compounds"*

**The Study:**
[One paragraph. Who (institution), what (study type: RCT, meta-analysis, observational, systematic review), where (journal, year), how big (n=participants or studies). This is the credibility paragraph.]

> *Example: "A 2024 systematic review from the University of Barcelona, published in Food Research International, analyzed 36 studies on EVOO behavior during cooking — total sample: 2,847 oil samples across temperatures from 120°C to 240°C."*

**Key Finding:**
[One sentence. Plain language. The main takeaway.]

**The Numbers:**

| Finding | Data | Context |
|---------|------|---------|
| [Specific finding] | [Number, percentage, measurement] | [Why this matters practically] |
| [Finding 2] | [Data] | [Context] |

**What This Means in the Galley:**
[2-3 sentences. Translate to action. How does this change what they do tomorrow? Be concrete — name a dish, a technique, a decision point.]

**What This Does Not Mean:**
[1-2 sentences. The overclaim people will make. Kill it before it spreads.]

**Limitations:**
- [Limitation 1 — sample size, population, methodology, industry funding]
- [Limitation 2 — what the study didn't test]

**Your Move:**
[One sentence. One action. Or: "No action needed — this confirms what you're already doing."]

**Source:** [Full citation with DOI or journal link]

## 5. EFFICIENCY PROTOCOL

### The Voice
A systems engineer who cooks. No fluff. Problem → solution → proof. If it can't be quantified, it doesn't belong here.

### The Rhythm
Name the pain. Fix the pain. Prove you fixed it. Warn what can break. Attribute who taught you.

### Template

---

**[PROTOCOL NAME]**
*[Category: Prep / Service / Storage / Cleanup / Provisioning / Equipment / Workflow]*

**The Pain:**
[One sentence. A specific frustration they feel daily or weekly. Not abstract — visceral.]

> *Example: "You're rebuilding your mise en place from scratch between lunch and dinner, pulling the same containers from the same spots, wasting 20 minutes you don't have."*
> *Example: "Your vacuum bags keep failing because you're sealing wet surfaces and the moisture breaks the seal during cooking."*
> *Example: "You're making three trips to provision what should take one because you're shopping by store, not by perishability."*

**The Protocol:**
[Numbered steps. Maximum 5. Each step is one action. Verb first.]

1. [Action — specific, measurable]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]
4. [Action]
5. [Action — if you need more than 5, split into two protocols]

**Why It Works:**
[One paragraph. The principle behind the hack — workflow science, thermodynamics, ergonomics, cognitive load reduction. Not just "it's faster." Why is it faster?]

**The Proof:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Time | [X minutes] | [Y minutes] |
| Steps/movements | [Count] | [Count] |
| Error rate | [Frequency] | [Frequency] |

*Or simpler:*
- **Time saved:** [X minutes per service/day/week]
- **Space saved:** [If applicable — in a yacht galley, this matters]
- **Cognitive load:** [Decisions eliminated, mental energy preserved for craft]

**The Catch:**
[What can go wrong. When NOT to use this. An honest limitation. This builds trust.]

> *Example: "Requires fridge space for full trays. On yachts under 40m, you'll need half-trays or strategic stacking."*
> *Example: "Only works if everyone on the team follows the same system. One person freelancing breaks it for everyone."*

**Who Taught Me This:**
[A specific chef, a specific yacht, a specific disaster. Make it human. Optional — but always better with it.]

> *Example: "The chef on Vava II fed 52 crew plus 12 guests. She had 9 trays in rotation. I watched her set up for a 7-course dinner in under 2 minutes. 'If you're thinking during service,' she said, 'you already lost.'"*

- Confident but not arrogant. "This works" not "this is the only way."
- Dry humor when it arrives naturally. Never forced.

**Numbers:**
- Always specific: 165°C not "high heat"
- Always in context: "47 minutes (±3 for thickness)"
- Tables for comparisons. Always.
- Metric first. Imperial in parentheses only if US audience warrants it.

**Sources:**
- Every claim: sourced or marked as personal experience
- Tier 1: peer-reviewed papers, McGee, Myhrvold, López-Alt
- Tier 2: named chefs with verifiable experience
- Rejected: blog posts, unsourced claims, "common knowledge"

**The Test:**
Would a chef on a 60m yacht, mid-charter, at 11pm, spend 60 seconds on this section? If yes, publish. If no, rewrite until yes.

### Pre-Publish Checklist

**Accuracy:**
- [ ] All facts cross-referenced with second source
- [ ] All temperatures verified
- [ ] All historical claims checked (not just repeated)
- [ ] All scientific claims linked to research

**Usefulness:**
- [ ] Answers "so what?" within the first 50 words
- [ ] Includes specific, actionable information
- [ ] Works in yacht context (space, motion, timing, limited equipment)

**Engagement:**
- [ ] Opening line earns the second line
- [ ] At least one moment of surprise per section
- [ ] Last line is as good as the first (Peak-End Rule)

**Authenticity:**
- [ ] Sounds like a chef talking to a chef
- [ ] Zero marketing language ("game-changer," "hack your cooking," "elevate")
- [ ] Honest about limitations, failures, and what doesn't work
