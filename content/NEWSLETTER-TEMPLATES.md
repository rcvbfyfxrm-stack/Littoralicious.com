## 1. TECHNIQUE OF THE WEEK

### Purpose
One actionable, science-backed technique that changes how they cook. Not theory. Practice.

### Structure

```
[HOOK — 1 sentence that creates tension or curiosity]

[THE TECHNIQUE — What to do, precisely]

[THE SCIENCE — Why it works, 2-3 sentences max]

[THE VARIABLES — What affects the outcome]

[THE TEST — How to verify it worked]

[THE YACHT ANGLE — Maritime-specific consideration]
```

### Template

---

**[TECHNIQUE NAME]: [Provocative subtitle that challenges assumption]**

**The Move:** [One sentence. What you're going to do differently.]

**The Setup:**
- [Precise instruction 1]
- [Precise instruction 2]
- [Precise instruction 3]

**Why It Works:**
[2-3 sentences of food science. Name the reaction, the compound, the physics. Be specific. "The Maillard reaction accelerates above 140°C" not "high heat makes things brown."]

**The Variables:**
| Factor | Effect | Adjust By |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| [Variable 1] | [What happens] | [How to compensate] |
| [Variable 2] | [What happens] | [How to compensate] |

**The Test:**
[How do you know it worked? Give a measurable outcome. Temperature, time, visual cue, texture description.]

**At Sea:**
[One yacht-specific consideration. Motion, humidity, equipment limitations, timing with service.]

**Source:** [Link to research paper, food science text, or named expert]

### Structure

```
[OPENING — A fact that stops the scroll]

[IDENTITY — What it is, where it's from]

[HISTORY — One story that sticks]

[SCIENCE — The compound that matters]

**[INGREDIENT NAME]**
*[Latin name if applicable] · [Region of origin] · [Season]*

**The Fact:** [One surprising statistic or historical fact that earns attention]

**What You're Actually Buying:**
[2-3 sentences. What is this ingredient, really? Botanical family, what part of the plant/animal, why it tastes the way it does.]

**The History:**
[One paragraph. A story—trade routes, cultural significance, a specific person or moment. Make it memorable. Not a Wikipedia summary.]

**The Compound:**
[Name the primary flavor/aroma compound. What else contains it? This is where surprising pairings come from.]

| Compound | Also Found In | Flavor Note |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| [e.g., Myristicin] | [e.g., Nutmeg, Parsley] | [e.g., Warm, slightly psychoactive] |

**Unexpected Pairings (Science-Backed):**
Based on shared volatile compounds:
- **[Ingredient] + [Surprising partner]** — [Why it works]
- **[Ingredient] + [Surprising partner]** — [Why it works]
- **[Ingredient] + [Surprising partner]** — [Why it works]

*Source: [Foodpairing.com / Volatile Compounds in Food database / specific research]*

**What to Look For:**
- [Visual cue for quality]
- [Texture indicator]

**One Way to Use It:**
[A single preparation. 3-4 sentences. Something they haven't thought of. Not a full recipe—an idea.]

## GENERAL WRITING PRINCIPLES

### Voice
- Direct. No hedging with "perhaps" or "might consider."
- Technical when precision matters. Plain when it doesn't.
- Confident but not arrogant. "This works" not "This is the only way."
- Occasional dry humor. Never forced jokes.

### Numbers
- Always specific: 165°C not "high heat"
- Always include context: "47 minutes (±3 for thickness variation)"
- Use tables for comparisons
- Metric primary, Imperial in parentheses

### Sources
- Every claim sourced or marked as personal experience
- Prefer: peer-reviewed research, established food science texts (McGee, Myhrvold, López-Alt)
- Accept: named professional chefs with relevant experience
- Reject: blog posts, unsourced claims, "common knowledge"

### Length Targets
| Section | Word Count | Read Time |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Technique of the Week | 250-350 | 1-1.5 min |
| Ingredient Spotlight | 400-500 | 2 min |
| Galley Efficiency Hack | 150-250 | 1 min |
| Littoral Recipe | 500-700 | 2-3 min |
| Research Brief | 200-300 | 1 min |
