# Monaco Provisioning: The Honest Guide

Everyone tells you to use the big chandlers. Here's what they don't tell you.

## The Markup Structure

Monaco yacht chandlers operate on a tiered markup system that isn't published anywhere:

| Item Category | Typical Markup | What This Means |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Staples (dry goods) | 35-50% | €15 olive oil costs €20-22.50 |
| Fresh produce | 60-80% | €5 lettuce becomes €8-9 |
| Premium proteins | 40-60% | €80/kg wagyu becomes €112-128/kg |
| Specialty items | 80-120% | Good luck with that truffle |
| Beverages (wine) | 40-60% | Sometimes competitive due to volume |
| Beverages (spirits) | 25-40% | Lower margin, more competition |

**The hidden fee:** Most chandlers add a 3-5% "service charge" or "handling fee" that appears at invoice bottom. It's negotiable if you ask. Nobody asks.

## The Actually Good Suppliers

### For Daily Provisions

**Marché de la Condamine** — Monaco's main market. Quality is excellent, prices are Monaco-level but still 40% below chandler equivalent. Open 6:00-14:00, best selection before 9:00.

What to buy here:
- Vegetables (especially Mediterranean varieties)
- Herbs (fresher than any chandler can offer)
- Olives and tapenades
- Local cheeses

What to skip:
- Fish (better options exist)
- Meat (limited selection)

### For Fish

**Rungis Sud in Nice** — Worth the 25-minute drive. Wholesale access requires business registration, but most yacht companies have this. Prices are 50-60% of Monaco retail.

Operating hours: 3:00-11:00. The good stuff moves by 7:00.

**Nice Port** — Direct from boats. Arrive at 5:30-6:00 for the catch landing. Cash only. Quality is exceptional but availability is unpredictable. Build relationships; fishermen remember faces.

**Back-up: Maison Barale (Nice)** — Retail fish shop with wholesale prices for volume. Will deliver to Monaco for orders over €300.

### For Meat

**Boucherie J. Basso (Nice)** — Supplies several starred restaurants. Aging program is legitimate. Dry-aged beef availability varies; call ahead.

**Rungis Sud** — Wider selection than any Monaco source. Vacuum-packed primals ship well to the boat.

**For Japanese A5:** Order through chandler. The markup is painful but cold chain integrity matters. Alternatively, pre-order through Paris Rungis with 72-hour lead time.

### For Specialty & Dry Goods

**Maison Ferrero (Nice)** — Italian imports at reasonable prices. Pasta, olive oils, vinegars, dried goods. The selection exceeds any Monaco option.

**Costco Marseille** — 1.5 hours each way, but for a major provision, the savings on staples can exceed €500 per charter. Useful for:
- Bulk paper goods
- Cleaning supplies
- Certain alcohol (competitive pricing)
- Non-perishable staples

### For Wine & Spirits

**Nicolas (Monaco)** — Retail but competitive. Volume discounts available if you establish an account.

**Wine direct from domains** — For recurring needs, establish relationships with Provençal vineyards. Delivery to port is standard. Pricing is 30-40% below retail.

## The Nice Strategy

For all but emergency provisions, the Nice ecosystem beats Monaco:

1. **Rungis Sud** for proteins (5:30-7:00 AM)
2. **Nice Port or Barale** for fish (6:00-8:00 AM)
3. **Cours Saleya market** for vegetables/specialty (7:00-10:00 AM)
4. **Maison Ferrero** for Italian goods
5. **Return to boat** by 11:00

Total time: 4-5 hours
Total savings on a €3,000 provision: €800-1,200

The math works if you value your time at less than €200/hour. Most chefs do.

## When to Use Chandlers

Despite the markup, chandlers earn their fee when:

- **Time is genuinely constrained** — Owner arriving in 4 hours
- **Specialty items with cold chain risk** — Caviar, A5 beef, live shellfish
- **You need credit** — Chandlers extend payment terms; markets don't
- **Delivery to boat is complex** — Large vessel, difficult berth, security protocols
- **The item is rare** — White truffles in July, certain Japanese fish

## Negotiation Reality

**What's negotiable:**
- Service/handling fees (always ask)
- Volume discounts on wine (10%+ achievable)
- Delivery timing
- Payment terms

**What's not negotiable:**
- Base product pricing (it's what it is)
- Last-minute emergency orders (they have you)

**The relationship game:** Regular orders over €2,000/week will eventually get you better pricing. Nobody will offer; you must ask after establishing history.

## Port-Specific Notes

**Port Hercule:**
- Delivery drivers know the dock layout
- Security checks add 15-20 minutes
- Early morning deliveries (before 8:00) avoid tourist congestion

**Port de Fontvieille:**
- Easier access, less security friction
- Smaller berths = potential loading complications
- Some chandlers charge extra for delivery here

**Anchor (Larvotto, etc.):**
- Tender logistics add €50-150 per delivery depending on who's running the tender
- Consolidate deliveries to reduce tender trips
- Ice/cold chain is your problem once it's on the tender

## Emergency Protocols

It's 17:00. The owner wants Dover sole for 8 people tonight. Monaco options:

1. **Hotel Hermitage kitchen** — Will sell you what they have. Call the executive chef directly. Price is retail + premium but they move fast.

2. **Monte-Carlo Bay hotel** — Same arrangement possible.

3. **Beaulieu-sur-Mer fish shop** (15 min) — Often has what Monaco doesn't.

4. **Call it:** If sole isn't available, offer turbot. Better to serve excellent turbot than mediocre sole.

## The Reality Check

Monaco provisioning is a solved problem—everyone knows the chandlers, everyone uses them, everyone pays the markup. The question is whether the savings from alternative sourcing justify your time and logistics.

For a week-long charter with €15,000 provision budget:
- Full chandler route: ~€15,000
- Optimized Nice + selective chandler: ~€11,500-12,500
- Pure Nice sourcing: ~€10,500-11,000 (but logistics complexity)

The middle path usually makes sense. Use chandlers for convenience items and specialty products. Use Nice for volume proteins and produce. Use markets for herbs and daily fresh.
