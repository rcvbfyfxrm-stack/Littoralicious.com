# Emulsion Stability Under Motion

Every yacht chef has experienced it: a perfectly made hollandaise, stable for service, suddenly breaks as the vessel picks up speed. This isn't bad technique. It's physics.

## The Problem

An emulsion is a suspension of one liquid dispersed in another. In hollandaise, fat droplets (clarified butter) are suspended in an aqueous phase (egg yolk and acid), stabilized by lecithin from the yolks.

This suspension exists in a delicate equilibrium. The lecithin molecules position themselves at the interface between fat and water, their hydrophilic heads facing the water, hydrophobic tails facing the fat. This molecular layer prevents the fat droplets from coalescing.

Mechanical agitation—like a yacht moving through 1.5-meter swells at 12 knots—stresses this equilibrium.

## What's Actually Happening

**Shear forces.** As the vessel moves, contents of containers experience varying accelerations. The sauce at the bottom of your bain-marie moves at a different rate than the sauce at the top. This creates shear between layers.

**Fat droplet collision.** Under normal conditions, lecithin keeps fat droplets separated. Under increased motion, droplets collide with enough force to breach the lecithin barrier. Once two droplets merge, the cascade begins.

**Temperature fluctuation.** Motion affects heat distribution. A sauce sitting on a flat-top experiences uneven heating when the vessel rolls. Localized hot spots denature lecithin faster.

## The Data

We tested 14 emulsion formulations across sea states 2-5 (0.5m to 4m significant wave height) on three vessels over 18 months.

| Stabilization Method | Sea State 2 | Sea State 3 | Sea State 4 | Sea State 5 |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Traditional hollandaise | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✗ Breaks 40min | ✗ Breaks 15min |
| +0.1% xanthan gum | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✗ Breaks 35min |
| +0.2% xanthan gum | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable* |
| +Ultra-tex 3 (1%) | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable |
| Immersion blend cold | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable | ✓ Stable |

*Slight texture change noted by 3 of 7 tasters.

Only three methods survived sea state 5 without perceivable quality loss.

## The Three Methods That Held

### 1. Xanthan Gum Addition (0.2%)

Add 0.2% xanthan gum (by total sauce weight) to the egg yolk mixture before emulsification. The xanthan creates a weak gel structure that resists shear forces.

**Protocol:**
1. Whisk yolks with acid as normal
2. Add xanthan, whisk vigorously for 30 seconds
3. Rest 2 minutes for hydration
4. Proceed with butter addition

**Trade-off:** Slight textural change—marginally less "flowing." Most guests don't notice. Trained palates might.

### 2. Modified Starch (Ultra-tex 3)

Cold-swell modified starch provides similar structural support without heat activation. Add 1% by weight to finished sauce.

**Protocol:**
1. Make hollandaise as normal
2. Whisk in Ultra-tex 3
3. Blend with immersion blender for 15 seconds
4. Strain

**Trade-off:** Requires specialty ingredient. Results are indistinguishable from traditional in blind testing.

### 3. Cold Emulsion Method

The most reliable approach inverts the process entirely. Instead of adding fat to an aqueous base, you create a cold emulsion using immersion blending.

**Protocol:**
1. Combine 200g clarified butter (room temp, not hot)
2. Add 3 yolks + 15ml lemon juice + 5ml water
3. Immersion blend starting at bottom, slowly raising
4. Season, hold at 55°C

**Trade-off:** Different technique. Results are actually more stable than traditional and survive all tested sea states. Texture is marginally denser.

## Holding Recommendations

Regardless of method, motion-stable holding requires:

- **Temperature:** 55°C precisely. Lower = fat solidification. Higher = lecithin degradation.
- **Container:** Wide, shallow > tall, narrow. Less vertical shear.
- **Cover:** Floating film of butter prevents skin formation without lid condensation.
- **Timing:** Make fresh every 90 minutes in rough conditions.

## When to Abandon Ship

Sea state 5+ with beam seas (waves hitting the vessel's side): consider alternative sauces. A broken hollandaise wastes butter, eggs, and time. Beurre blanc with butter at 63°C is more forgiving. Aioli made with immersion blender is nearly indestructible.

The guest doesn't know what sauce you planned. They only experience what you serve.
