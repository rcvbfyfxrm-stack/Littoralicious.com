                    <p>
                        You're 40 nautical miles from the nearest port. The owner's just changed dinner to a seven-course tasting menu for twelve. You've got three hours, a rolling galley, and whatever you provisioned in Sardinia four days ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nobody writes for you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Food media is drowning in content designed to entertain people who will never cook professionally. Recipes optimized for Instagram. "Elevated" takes on classics that ignore why the classics exist. Influencers who've never worked a Saturday night service explaining what restaurants should do differently.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We're not that.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What We Believe</h2>

                    <p><strong>Science isn't optional.</strong> The Maillard reaction doesn't care about your grandmother's recipe. Understanding the chemistry gives you control. We explain the why so you can improvise the how.</p>

                    <p><strong>Specificity beats generality.</strong> "Cook until golden brown" is useless. <span class="data">165°C internal for 47 minutes at sea level</span> is actionable. We give you numbers, not vibes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Maritime cooking is its own discipline.</strong> You're dealing with motion, limited storage, irregular provisioning, equipment that corrodes, guests who change their minds, and a captain who doesn't understand why you need that extra cold storage. This context matters.</p>

                    <p><strong>Respect for the professional.</strong> You don't need us to tell you how to boil water. We assume competence. We build on it.</p>

                    <h2>What We Publish</h2>

                    <p><strong>Dispatches.</strong> Short, brutal news items. One insight per post. Published when relevant, not on a content calendar.</p>

                    <p><strong>Science Desk.</strong> Deep dives into food chemistry, physics, and biology. The kind of knowledge that separates a technician from a craftsman.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technique Files.</strong> Step-by-step protocols. No stories about our trip to Provence. Just the method, the science, and the variables you can adjust.</p>

                    <p><strong>Galley Notes.</strong> Yacht-specific intelligence. Provisioning ports. Equipment reviews from actual multi-year use. Managing expectations when the owner's friend is suddenly vegan.</p>

                    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sponsored content disguised as editorial</li>
                        <li>Listicles written for SEO</li>
                        <li>Coverage of restaurant openings we'll never visit</li>
                        <li>Chef personality profiles</li>
                        <li>"The 10 Best [Anything]"</li>
                        <li>Content that could be generated by prompting an AI with "write something about food"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Standards</h2>

                    <p>Every claim is sourced or tested. If we say a technique works, we've done it. If we cite research, we link to the paper. If we're speculating, we say so.</p>

                    <p>We assume you're intelligent enough to handle nuance. Not everything is a hack. Not every technique is revolutionary. Sometimes the traditional method is traditional because it works.</p>

                    <p>We respect your time. Articles end when they're done, not when they've hit a word count.</p>

                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

                    <p>
                        A collective of yacht chefs, food scientists, and culinary professionals who got tired of the gap between what food media publishes and what working chefs actually need.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We're not a media company. We don't have venture funding. We don't have a content strategy designed to maximize engagement. We have a point of view and the discipline to maintain it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How This Works</h2>

                    <p>
                        We publish what we think is valuable. You read what's useful to you. No paywalls. No accounts. No tracking beyond what's necessary to keep the servers running.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you find value here, tell other professionals. The only growth strategy we care about is being useful enough to be worth recommending.
                    </p>
