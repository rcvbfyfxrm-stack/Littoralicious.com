                        Everything we publish exists for one reason: to help you nurture the people you feed—and yourself. Mentally. Physically. Both are inseparable.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Core Belief</h2>

                    <p>
                        Food is not entertainment. Food is not content. Food is not a flex.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Food is how we care for each other. It's how we heal. It's how we sustain the body that carries us through life and the mind that makes life worth living.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you cook for someone, you're not just filling their stomach. You're affecting their mood, their energy, their sleep, their gut microbiome, their inflammation levels, their mental clarity. Every meal is an intervention—for better or worse.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We take that seriously.
                    </p>

                    <div class="science-box" style="margin: var(--space-8) 0;">
                        <span class="science-box__label">Core Philosophy</span>
                        <div class="science-box__content">
                            <p style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: var(--text-xl); line-height: var(--leading-snug); margin: 0; text-align: center;">
                                <strong>Nurture.</strong><br>
                                <span style="font-size: var(--text-lg);">Mentally and physically.</span>

                    <h2>Nurturing the Body</h2>

                    <p>
                        Every ingredient has a story written in molecules. Turmeric's curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier. Fermented foods rebuild gut bacteria that produce 90% of your serotonin. Omega-3s from wild fish reduce inflammation that drives depression. Dark chocolate triggers endorphin release.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This isn't wellness marketing. This is biochemistry. And when you understand it, every dish becomes an opportunity to heal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We publish the science—not so you can impress guests with trivia, but so you can make choices that genuinely improve the lives of the people you cook for.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Nurturing the Mind</h2>

                    <p>
                        The galley can be a lonely place. Weeks at sea. Endless hours. The pressure to perform while exhausted. The isolation of being the only one who understands what you do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We write for you too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mental health isn't separate from physical health. The stress you carry affects what you cook. The knowledge you gain gives you confidence. The community you find gives you resilience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Littoralicious exists to support the whole professional—not just the hands that plate, but the mind that creates and the person who goes home at the end of the charter.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What This Means in Practice</h2>

                    <p><strong>Science that serves.</strong> We explain the chemistry and biology not for academic interest, but because understanding gives you power. Power to adapt. Power to improve. Power to nurture with intention.</p>

                    <p><strong>Recipes that heal.</strong> Traditional coastal cuisines evolved over millennia. They're not just delicious—they're medicine. We document them with respect for what they offer the body and mind.</p>

                    <p><strong>Honest galley intelligence.</strong> Provisioning, efficiency, equipment—the practical knowledge that reduces your stress so you can focus on what matters: the people you're feeding.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mental wellbeing content.</strong> Resilience protocols. Stress management. The psychology of isolated work. Because nurturing others starts with nurturing yourself.</p>

                    <h2>Who We're For</h2>

                    <p>
                        Anyone who feeds others and takes that responsibility seriously.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yacht chefs managing impossible expectations at sea. Home cooks who understand that dinner shapes their family's health. Professionals who see cooking as care, not performance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you believe food is how we nurture each other, you're in the right place.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Arnaud Callier</strong> — A decade in superyacht galleys. 50,000+ nautical miles. From M/Y Symphony to Vava II, Christina O., Cloud 9, and Kismet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Years of feeding others taught me something: the best meals I ever made weren't the most impressive. They were the ones that left people feeling genuinely better. Calmer. More energized. More themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's what I want Littoralicious to be about. Not showing off. Not content for content's sake. Just the knowledge and tools to nurture people—body and mind—through the food we make.
