                    <h2>The Space Constraint Reality</h2>
                    <p>
                        A typical yacht galley offers between 4 and 12 square meters of working space. Compare this to a restaurant kitchen's 40-100 square meters. The ratio of output expected to space available is inverted: guests expect restaurant-quality dining from a workspace smaller than most home kitchens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn't a limitation to overcome. It's a design parameter to optimize around.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Three Zones System</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every galley, regardless of size, must be mentally divided into three zones:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Zone 1: Hot Production</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stovetop, oven, salamander. This zone operates at temperatures above 100°C and requires immediate access to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat-resistant utensils within arm's reach</li>
                        <li>Timing devices (visible, not audible—noise competes with guest areas)</li>
                        <li>Extraction positioned to pull steam away from plating areas</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Zone 2: Cold Assembly</h3>
                    <p>
                        Refrigerated workspace for salads, cold appetizers, dessert plating. Temperature maintenance is critical. In Mediterranean summer, ambient galley temperatures can reach 35°C. Your cold zone needs:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dedicated refrigerated surface or chilled plates</li>
                        <li>Separation from hot zone (minimum 60cm or thermal barrier)</li>
                        <li>Direct access to refrigeration without crossing hot zone</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Zone 3: Staging</h3>
                    <p>
                        The pass. Where plates wait for service. In yacht galleys, this zone often doesn't exist as a dedicated space—it must be created through timing and crew coordination.

                    <h2>The 60-Second Rule</h2>
                    <p>
                        No ingredient or tool should require more than 60 seconds to retrieve from your working position. If it does, it needs to move closer or be prepped earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Audit your current setup:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stand at your primary cooking position</li>
                        <li>Time yourself retrieving every ingredient for your most complex dish</li>
                        <li>Anything over 60 seconds gets relocated or pre-staged</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Mise en Place Architecture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Restaurant mise en place assumes stable conditions. Yacht mise en place must account for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Motion:</strong> Everything must be secured. Third pans in hotel pans, silicone lids, non-slip mats under everything</li>
                        <li><strong>Temperature fluctuation:</strong> Prep completed in port may sit for hours during a crossing. Cold-chain integrity requires planning</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule uncertainty:</strong> A 7pm service can become 9pm with one weather delay. Your mise must hold</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Daily Reset Protocol</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every morning, before any cooking begins:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Inventory sweep:</strong> 5 minutes. What's running low? What needs using?</li>
                        <li><strong>Temperature log:</strong> All refrigeration units. Record. Report anomalies immediately</li>
                        <li><strong>Equipment check:</strong> Burners ignite? Oven calibrated? Induction responsive?</li>
                        <li><strong>Service brief:</strong> Guest count, dietary requirements, timing expectations</li>
                        <li><strong>Prep list prioritization:</strong> What must happen first? What can wait?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Total time: 15 minutes. Non-negotiable.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Motion Economy</h2>
                    <p>
                        In confined spaces, wasted movement isn't just inefficient—it's dangerous. Hot pans, sharp knives, and a rolling vessel don't forgive unnecessary turns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Principles:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Work flows in one direction: ingredients in, plates out</li>
                        <li>Dominant hand faces the heat source</li>
                        <li>Garbage positioned for drop, not throw</li>
                        <li>Clean as you go isn't optional—it's survival</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Crew Integration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unlike restaurants, yacht service involves crew entering the galley. Steward/ess traffic patterns must be anticipated:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designate a pickup zone that doesn't require crossing your workspace</li>
                        <li>Establish call-and-response for service timing</li>
                        <li>Brief crew on hot zones before each service</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        This protocol isn't implemented in a day. Start with the Daily Reset. Add zones in week two. Refine motion economy over month one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal: a galley that functions as an extension of your intentions, not an obstacle to them.
                    </p>
