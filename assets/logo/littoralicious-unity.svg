    LITTORALICIOUS UNITY

    The Convergence — Four becoming one

    Concept: Four elements flow into a central point.
    That point is nurture. That point is the plate.
    That point is the moment of feeding another.

    The geometry is original: four curved paths
    converging to center, each carrying its element.
